The minimum requirements of a html-page has to be the html-verson declaration (<!DOCTYPE html>) in order
for the browser to know which html-version it's supposed to render. It also needs tags to determin the
different parts of the page, like the <head> for the necessary dependencies, <title>-tag and metadata or the
<body>-tag where the actual content of the webpage is. The bare minimum is the version declaration, the different tags
and, unless you want a blank page, some content within the tags.

Assets are the parts that makes the webpage great; CSS-stylesheets and fonts that make the page look good,
images that are content or part of the styling of the page and Javascript-code that makes the webpage have
functionality and/or interactivity. Other assets that can be used are frameworks to add even more functionality
to the page.
